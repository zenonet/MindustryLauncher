## Tech

Mindustry Launcher is written in [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp) and uses [Avalonia UI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) for crossplatform UI. [OctoKit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net) (a dotnet library for the Github API) is used to access the Mindustry Repo and download releases from there.
